Structure Synth is an attempt to make a 3D version of <a href="http://www.chriscoyne.com/cfdg/">CFDG</a> by Chris Coyne, which has been popularized by the <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/">Context Free GUI</a> by Mark Lentczner and John Horigan. </p><p>The EisenScript syntax of Structure Synth was heavily inspired by CDFG, though it has been modified a few places.</p>
