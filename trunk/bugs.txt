Bug List:
---------
Priority 0-5, 5 is worst:

- [4] Lines and dots do not respect color settings.
- [3] Parser do not allow operator names as rule names. 'rule R1 maxdepth 2 > c ' fails.
- [3] No sorting while alpha-blending. All opaque objects should be drawn before transparent. Turn off Z-buffer while drawing.
- [3] Face Culling does not work for boxes, when coordinates are flipped.
- [2] A self-refering cycle of rule retirements would crash structure synth.
- [1] 'Save as...' and 'Load...' should default to '*.es* filter
