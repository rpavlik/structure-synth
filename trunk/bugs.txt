Bug List:
---------
Priority 0-5, 5 is worst:

- [3] Syntax highlightning has issues: missing keywords, fails after \t, (Notice: '\tTriangles' does not parse!), does not update properly after copy and paste.
- [3] 'Template Render to File' saves files with \d\d\a carriage returns
- [3] Parser do not allow operator names as rule names. 'rule R1 maxdepth 2 > c ' fails.
- [3] No sorting while alpha-blending. All opaque objects should be drawn before transparent. Turn off Z-buffer while drawing.
- [3] Face Culling does not work for boxes, when coordinates are flipped.
- [2] A self-refering cycle of rule retirements would crash structure synth.
