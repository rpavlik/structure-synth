ROADMAP
-------

Version 0.5: 'Graf Zeppelin' (Release first binaries (WIN) here)
----------------------------
+ Rotations are not around the proper unit cube axis.
+ Add global 'set' command
+ 'set maxobjects'
+ Preprocessor Comments
+ Auto load examples to menu item entry.
+ Coloring 
+ GUI: Rotate about z axis
+ Solid Box object
+ Rule retirement:
  + (1) with substitution:  [ RULE r1 maxdepth 400 > r2 weigth 100 { ... } ]
  + (3) plain retirement [ RULE r1 maxdepth 400 weigth 100 { ... } ]
+ Version object
+ Iterated Rules
+ Scale with 3 parameters.
+ Progress dialog w/ cancel.
+ Fix multiple windows problems
+ 'Color' keyword (for absolute color)
+ 'Background' set command 
+ 'set seed'
+ Add 'Reset button' (for OpenGL view)
- Create a build (resolve dependencies)

Version 0.8: 'Memories of tomorrow' [v 0.8]
----------------------------------
- 'set minvolume'
- Tagging (e.g. [sphereresolution 3 25])
       - OpenGL settings (as tags): Perspective, Fog, Coloring, Res, 
- Ellipsoid object. (as of now spheres are always isotropic]
- Full Screen
- Screenshot
- Context Menu in 3D GUI: 'Reset View', 'Save Screenshot', Full screen.
- Custom Transformation matrix operator.
- Preprocessor '#include' statement
- Skew transformations (syntax?)
- Version object with check for updates on internet.
- GUI Seed
- 'Zoom to fit'
- Real transperancy (req. sorting)
- More complex primitives (tube, ...)
- Better parsing (faulty tokens should be highlighted in editor)
- Linux testing
- Check for infinite retirement substitution cycles.
- Better Progress Bar (include updates for transformations loop, pause button?)
- Drag'n'Drop of EisenScript files.
- Set initial viewport (create expression by right clicking mouse canvas)
- Dump used seed 

Version 1.0: Kolberger Heide.
-----------------------------
! Tabbed interface
- Add more renders:
  - [Tag Renderer] - renders all tag as text.
  ! [PovRay] Renderer
  - [Collada] Support? (http://www.khronos.org/collada/)
- Rule retirement: ? (2) with subst. and revive: [ RULE r1 maxdepth 400 >> r2 weigth 100 { ... } ]
- Splash screen with proper acknowledgement.
- Preferences (saving with QProperties)
- Save screenshot
- Mac testing
- Installers (for Windows at least - using InnoSetup)
- Packaging: Icons, Eula, file associations.

v 2.x
-----
- Textures w. alpha
- 2D Mode
- Parameterized rendering (movies)
  - Random parameters in rule definition
- Option for Synchronize random seed per generation. (Each expanded rule starts at the same seed).
? 4D geometry, creating animations by slicing through the 4th dimension.
? JavaScript usage of the rendering API (this would be like a lite version of Processing (In JS instead of Java)) 
? Geometry Distortion plugins (a la fish eye view)
? Built-in ray tracer.
? Live coding / drawing
  - Perhaps by assigning keyboard keys to rules? [but how?]
? Meta-programming via the [Tag Renderer]
