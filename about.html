Structure Synth is my attempt to make a 3D version of <a href="http://www.chriscoyne.com/cfdg/">CFDG by Chris Coyne</a>, which has been popularized by the <a href="http://www.contextfreeart.org/">Context Free GUI</a> by Mark Lentczner and John Horigan. The EisenScript syntax of Structure Synth was heavily inspired by the CDFG, but has been modified a few places.</p>


<p>The Icons I use are part of the <a href="http://www.everaldo.com/crystal/">Everaldo: Crystal</a> project. </p>
<p>Structure Synth is built using the <a href="http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index">Qt cross-platform GUI framework.</a> </p>
