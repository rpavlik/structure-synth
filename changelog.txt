[1h]            Turns out, that QtScriptd4.dll works just fine, but my QtScript4.dll does not, and crashes when called into. This is weird.
                Well, I tried linking to another set of DLL found here (http://pallas.copai.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=58), and these works too.
                Weirdness. Well, recompiling the entire Qt just takes too long, so I will not test this.

                Implemented Template Render to File:
                -> Notice: a small bug: it saves files with \d\d\a carriage returns (instead of \d\a). Don't know why yet
                Added 'Auto Increment' check box, for whether the seed should auto increment (makes this a bit more logic to use)
				Added support for different Template classes:
                -> Now it possible to specify a class signifier for a primitive object:
                -> For instance 'box::metal'.
                -> The OpenGL will just ignore this, but the Template Renderers
                -> will try to find a substitution of the type:
                -> <substitution name="box" type="metal">


05 May 08 [MHC] Created initial DoxyGen setup.
[1½h]a
