[3h] a

15 May 08 [MHC] Completed the Template Rendering code.
[2½h]c          Corrected a small bug in the syntax-highlightning
                Implemented Template Render to File:
                -> Notice: a small bug: it saves files with \d\d\a carriage returns (instead of \d\a). Don't know why yet
                Added 'Auto Increment' check box, for whether the seed should auto increment (makes this a bit more logic to use)
				Added support for different Template classes:
                -> Now it possible to specify a class signifier for a primitive object:
                -> For instance 'box::metal'.
                -> The OpenGL will just ignore this, but the Template Renderers
                -> will try to find a substitution of the type:
                -> <substitution name="box" type="metal">

[1½h]a
